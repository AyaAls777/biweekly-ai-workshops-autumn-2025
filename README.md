##  UOWD AI Team: Bi-Weekly Workshop Series (Autumn 2025)

Hands-on code and resources prepared by the UOWD AI Team for our bi-weekly workshops, starting with **ML Foundations in Action** and progressing to **building an AI-powered app using deep learning**.

All notebooks and demos were developed collaboratively by the team.  

**As AI Team Leader, I guided the technical direction, mentored the team, and oversaw the implementation of all workshop code.**

### 🧠 Workshop 1: *ML Foundations in Action*

**Week 3 • Thursday • 4:30 PM – 6:30 PM • Room 6.36**

Students built a **Spotify-style music recommender** using **Kaggle datasets** in Google Colab.

They learned:
- How to represent songs numerically (danceability, energy, tempo, valence)  
- Preprocessing, scaling, and clustering with **scikit-learn**  
- Cosine similarity and its limitations  
- Visualizing song clusters using **PCA**  

**Focus:**  
Understanding the ML workflow using real Kaggle data.

### 🤖 Workshop 2: *Build Your First AI App (Deep Learning Edition)*

**Week 7 • Thursday • 4:30 PM – 6:30 PM • Room 4.52**

This workshop expanded beyond classical ML into **deep learning, embeddings, LLMs, and interactive app building** using Gradio.

### ⭐ Student Activities
Students completed multiple hands-on activities:
- **Kahoot recap quiz** (Workshop 1 concepts)  
- **Teachable Machine demo** : visualizing how neural networks learn  
- **Text embedding comparison** using MiniLM, BGE, and MPNet  
- Typing phrases such as *“portable PC”* to compare semantic similarity  
- **Audio embedding extraction** with MuQ  
- **3D embedding visualization** (t-SNE) for song clusters  
- **Building a Gradio AI app** combining LLMs, text embeddings, and audio embeddings  
- **Final Kahoot quiz**  

**Focus:**  
Transitioning from basic ML to modern multimodal AI systems.
